        <p id="txtDepth1">Over 60% of our planet is covered by water more than a mile deep. The deep sea is the largest habitat on earth and is largely unexplored. Most people familiar with the oceans know about life only in the intertidal zone, where the water meets land, and the epipelagic zone, the upper sunlit zone of the open ocean. Though these zones contain an abundance of ocean life because sunlight is available for photosynthesis, they make up only a small fraction of the ocean biome. </p>
        <p id="blankSpace1"></p>
        <p id="txtDepth2">The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. The sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide range, and migrates seasonally. It has the largest brain on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live 70+ years.</p>
        <p id="blankSpace2"></p>
        <p id="txtDepth3">Some of the first known findings pertaining to the goblin shark were published in 1910, and the researcher wrote that, "the new shark is certainly grotesque." The giant Pacific octopus is the largest octopus species and have about 300 million neurons. These animals can be found from the intertidal zone down to 2,000 m.</p>
        <p id="blankSpace3"></p>
        <p id="txtDepth3">Once you pass 1,000 meters, the water is completely devoid of light. At this depth temperatures plummet to 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and constantly stay near freezing. We now know that despite this lack of light, many creatures can live in this extreme place.</p>
        <p id="blankSpace4"></p>
        <p id="txtDepth3">Dumbo octopuses live in the deep open ocean down to depths of at least 4000 m and perhaps much deeper, making this group the deepest living of all known octopuses. Life at these extreme depths requires the ability to live in very cold water and in the complete absence of sunlight. </p>
        <p id="blankSpace5"></p>
        <p id="txtDepth3">The megamouth shark is a species of deepwater shark. It is rarely seen by humans and is the smallest of the three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the whale shark and basking shark. Since its discovery in 1976, few megamouth sharks have been seen, with fewer than 100 specimens being observed or caught.</p>
